# Welcome to my GitHub Profile!
My name is Ethan, also known as Ittim! I am studying Computer Information Systems as part-time employee at my local community college. I'm employed as a Prometric Test Center Administrator. Prometric specializes in secure testing for a broad array of certifications from mechanics to medical. I spend my free time like most college students: playing video games, recording podcast episodes, goofing off with my friends on Discord, or chilling at the Student Life department.[^1]

Now, with the intorduction out of the way, let me explain what I & my team do! We create *stuff*. So far we're working on the following website, discord bots,and mobile app!:
